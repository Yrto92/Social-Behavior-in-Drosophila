# Social-Behavior-in-Drosophila
An analytical framework for studying the interplay between social experience and group interaction in Drosophila melanogaster.

# **SUMMARY**
Living in a group creates a complex and dynamic environment in which the behavior of individuals is influenced
by and affects the behavior of others. Although social interaction and group living are fundamental adaptations exhibited by many organisms, little is known about how prior social experience, internal states, and
group composition shape behavior in groups. Here, we present an analytical framework for studying the
interplay between social experience and group interaction in Drosophila melanogaster. We simplified the
complexity of interactions in a group using a series of experiments in which we controlled the social experience and motivational states of individuals to compare behavioral patterns and social networks of groups
under different conditions.
